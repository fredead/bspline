 This is a BSpline program written for some GFX project in GTK

 GTK has advanced quite considerably since writing this code
 so I dont really know whether it still compiles ??

 The makefile might need to be tweaked depending where your
 GTK libraries are held.

 The fonts section are not done through GTK due to a time
 constriant and diffculties with GTK this should be 
 changes at some time.
